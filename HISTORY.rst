0.1.21 (2016-03-20)
______________________

* Parts with valid Digi-Key web pages were not appearing in the spreadsheet

  to increase the probability of the search finding the correct part.


0.1.19 (2016-02-12)

  have that field defined.

  #. It is identical to another part or parts which do have a manf. part number.
  #. There are no other identical parts with a different manf. part number than the ones in item #2.
